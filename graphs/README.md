# Network Graph Simulation

A Python-based network graph simulation for visualizing and analyzing shortest paths, resource management, and request handling in directed and undirected graphs. This simulation utilizes `networkx` and `matplotlib` for graph operations and visualizations.

## Features

- **Graph Creation**: Generate directed or undirected graphs with nodes and weighted edges.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Resource Management**: Track resources such as distance, time, and available paths between nodes.
- **Visualization**: Visualize graphs and paths using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `networkx`
- `matplotlib`

Install requirements using:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
'''
